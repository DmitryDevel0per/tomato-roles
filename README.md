{
    use HasRoles;
    
```

## Using

you can use the package by GUI and you can generate a new permission by set the permission name to the route name and after that use `tomato-roles.php` config to set the custom permission you need for this route when you add a new one you will get the new permission when you edit the role or add new and the package will auto create the permission for you.

if you need to build a full resource permission when you use [Tomato Admin](https://github.com/queents/tomato-admin) you can use this command and it will auto generate it for you

```bash
php artisan tomato:roles
```

and just gave it the name of the table.
